# RMED901 Data science with R for medical researchers 
# Created on: 12.09.2023
# Written by: Group 4
# Group members: Mariam Reda, Isil Kucuka, Bente Sved Skottvoll, Mari Eskild Rasmussen
# Purpose: Group project for evaluating progress of learning output using R, package tidyverse and coworking by shared GitHub repository
=======

#Task #1 
Create an RStudio project (done on 11.09.2023) 
 
#Task #2 Read and tidy the dataset 
 
We agreed to work first individually (on different branches), then compare our scripts and merge them into one. 

Checklist: 
-Are there unique obs in the dataset? (Duplications?) 
Ans: Gender is repeated in the gender column, and also in gender_arm variable Duplications: 


-Are there any columns starting in a number, containing space? 
Ans: no 
-Are all variables as columns? 
Ans: Yes 
-Are there any columns containing combined variables? 
Ans: Yes, gender_arm variable and baseline_condition, baseline_temp_cat, baseline_esr_cat, strep_resistance, X6m_radiologic.

-Recommended changes

1) Removing the gender from the arm variable
2) Sort the years and patient ids
3) Improved variable can be changed to TRUE=1, False=0
4) baseline cavitation can be changed to Yes=1, no=0
5) Keeping the numbers (values rating the answers) in the condition variables instead of the text
6) Removing the number from the variable 6m_radiologic at the beginning
7) changing gender to 0,1 
8) changing control and intervention to 0,1

#DAY 5:
tidied the data
checked for duplicates
separated columns so that the categorical data, text explanation and the numeric data of the same variable will be in separate columns.
First, I tried deleting the columns with text and only keep the numeric and categorical, then we agreed on keeping all versions in case we might need that information.

The explanation of categories are below:
changed the columns that include both the category number and the explanation of the category, further info:
CATEGORIES:
baseline condition:
1= Good
2= Fair
3= Poor

baseline_temp_cat:
1= 98-98.9F
2= 99-99.9F
3= 100-100.9F
4= 101F+

baseline_esr_cat:
2= 11-20
3= 21-50
4= 51+

strep_resistance:
1= sens 0-8
2= mod 8-99
3= resist 100+

X6m_radiologic:
1= Death
2= Considerable deterioration
3= Moderate deterioration
4= No change
5= Moderate improvement
6= Considerable improvement


DAY 6:
removed year column
changed variable types (in categorical data) from character to numeric.
Did exploration of the data, by counting, selecting columns of interest.
Instruction (exam_descr) line 57.

DAY 7:
continued with exploring the data. (exam_descr line 57)
Used summary(), head(), tail(), names()

Completed instruction line 65:
"Use two categorical columns in your dataset to create a table."

Completed instruction line 71:
"Does the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in mm per hour at baseline distribution depend on `gender`?"
Answer= no, it does not depend on gender.

Completed instruction line 72:
"Does the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in mm per hour at baseline distribution depend on `baseline_temp`?"
Answer= yes, it depends on baseline_temp. There is a positive correlation.
