Comments to exam questions, Mari:

What to do:
- gender_arm should be changed to just arm (gender is already a column)
- baseline condition should be changed (remove number)
- the baseline temp_cat have strange categories. Could it be changed into numerical values? 

Some patients are registered several times, only thing that differs is the inclusion time. Are these duplicates?

This study is from 1948 so the year must be wrong

Categories should be corrected

Suggestion: to create a subset with only the most relevant columns, excluding month and year and then remove the duplicates
